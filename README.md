# oxenv-vbox
A simple programming environment for Oxford undergraduates

This is a lightweight installation of Debian Linux with the Raspberry
Pi desktop and the software tools needed for some lecture courses,
specifically Digital Systems and Compilers, packaged as a virtual
machine.  Look under Releases to download an Open Virtualisation
Archive (OVA) file.

The script `oxenv.tcl` automates preparing the OVA: see
https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/Making_a_VirtualBox_image for a
description of the process, and
https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/Installing_the_Oxenv_virtual_appliance
for intructions on installing the resulting appliance.
